/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<p>This tutorial aims to illustrate the process of computing <strong>classical molecular interaction potentials</strong> from <strong>protein structures</strong>, step by step, using the <strong>BioExcel Building Blocks library (biobb)</strong>. Examples shown are <strong>Molecular Interaction Potentials (MIPs) grids, protein-protein/ligand interaction potentials, and protein titration</strong>. The particular structures used are the <strong>Lysozyme</strong> protein (PDB code <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1aki">1AKI</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1AKI/pdb">https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1AKI/pdb</a>), the <strong>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</strong> kinase domain (PDB code <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4HJO">4HJO</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb4HJO/pdb">https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb4HJO/pdb</a>) complexed with the <strong>Erlotinib</strong> inhibitor (PDB code <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/AQ4">AQ4</a>, DrugBank Ligand Code <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00530">DB00530</a>),  and a MD simulation of the complex formed by the <strong>SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain and the human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2</strong> (PDB code <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6vw1">6VW1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6VW1/pdb">https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb6VW1/pdb</a>).</p>

<h2 id="Structural-water-molecules-&amp;-ions">Structural water molecules &amp; ions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Structural-water-molecules-&amp;-ions">¶</a></h2><p>One of the many steps involved in the <strong>MD structure setup process</strong> is the addition of <strong>solvent and counterions</strong> (when working with explicit solvent). <strong>Solvent molecules</strong> and <strong>counterions</strong> are usually integrated on the <strong>structure surface</strong> in two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structural waters/ions</strong>: A <strong>first shell</strong> of <strong>water molecules and ions</strong> is commonly added in the <strong>energetically most favorable positions</strong> on the surface of the structure. It is a computationally expensive process and is usually reduced to just tens of <strong>water molecules</strong> and <strong>ions</strong> (depending on the structure size).</li>
<li><strong>Solvent box/ionic concentration</strong>: A box of <strong>solvent molecules</strong> is created surrounding the original structure, and an additional number of <strong>ions</strong> are added until reaching a desired <strong>ionic concentration</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whereas the second step is integrated in all the <strong>MD packages</strong>, the first one is rarely available. <strong>CMIP</strong> and the <strong>biobb_titration building block</strong> is helping in this task.</p>

<h2 id="Molecular-Interaction-Potentials-(MIPs)">Molecular Interaction Potentials (MIPs)<a class="anchor-link" href="#Molecular-Interaction-Potentials-(MIPs)">¶</a></h2><p><strong>Molecular interaction potentials (MIP)</strong> are field properties arising from the interaction of a <strong>probe</strong> (e.g., methyl, proton or water) with a molecule. These are calculated in the surface of the molecule, with a grid defined around the structure.</p>
<p><strong>MIPs</strong> are one of the most important molecular properties in the relationship between <strong>molecular and binding data</strong> (e.g. <em>3D Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships, 3D-QSAR</em>), and is extensively applied in <strong>drug discovery</strong> processes.</p>
<p>In this example, three different <strong>MIPs</strong> are used, with a <strong>Water Oxygen atom</strong> as a probe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Positive</strong> MIP - highlighting the protein regions with <strong>higher affinity</strong> to <strong>negatively charged groups</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Negative</strong> MIP - highlighting the protein regions with <strong>higher affinity</strong> to <strong>positively charged groups</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Neutral</strong> MIP - highlighting the protein regions with <strong>lower affinity</strong> to <strong>electrocharged groups</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Building Blocks</strong> used:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://biobb-cmip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cmip.html#module-cmip.cmip">cmip</a> from <strong>biobb_cmip.cmip.cmip</strong></li>

<h2 id="Interaction-Potential-Energies">Interaction Potential Energies<a class="anchor-link" href="#Interaction-Potential-Energies">¶</a></h2><p>Closely related to the previous study of <strong>Molecular Interaction Potentials</strong>, the <strong>Interaction Potential Energies</strong> calculation computes the contributions to the <strong>total energy</strong> of the system from the different <strong>interactions between the subunits of the molecule</strong> considered. These <strong>interaction energies</strong> usually depend on the relation between the <strong>charge</strong> and <strong>positions</strong> of the units studied (e.g. <em>electrostatic, van der Waals</em>) and the <strong>solvation energy</strong> (energy released when a compound is dissolved in a solvent).</p>
<p><strong>Interaction Potential Energies</strong> give useful insights in the <strong>macromolecular interaction</strong> process, with the possibility to identify <strong>key residues</strong> involved in the interaction, and thus being another key component of the <strong>drug discovery</strong> process.</p>
<p>To illustrate the calculation of the <strong>interaction potentials</strong> between two subunits of a <strong>structure complex</strong> (e.g. protein-protein, protein-ligand), two different examples are used:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</strong> kinase domain with <strong>Erlotinib</strong> inhibitor.</li>
<li><strong>SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain</strong> with <strong>human Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2</strong>.</li>

<h2 id="Protein-Ligand-Interaction-Energies">Protein-Ligand Interaction Energies<a class="anchor-link" href="#Protein-Ligand-Interaction-Energies">¶</a></h2><p>This example illustrates the steps needed to compute the <strong>protein-ligand interaction energies</strong> from a <strong>crystal structure</strong> of the <strong>complex</strong> taken directly from the <strong>PDB data bank</strong>. The particular example used is the <strong>Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor</strong> kinase domain (PDB code [4HJO](<a href="https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4HJO">https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4HJO</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb4HJO/pdb">https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb4HJO/pdb</a>) with <strong>Erlotinib</strong> inhibitor (PDB code <a href="https://www.rcsb.org/ligand/AQ4">AQ4</a>, DrugBank Ligand Code <a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00530">DB00530</a>).</p>
<p>To properly compute the <strong>interaction energies</strong>, the <strong>protein-ligand</strong> complex needs to be pre-processed, adding the (typically) missing <strong>hydrogen atoms</strong>, finding out the <strong>atomic charges</strong> and <strong>elements</strong>, and <strong>relaxing</strong> the structure to avoid <strong>steric issues</strong> due to <strong>crystallographic packing</strong>. All these steps are performed in the following cells using <strong>BioBB building blocks</strong></p>

<h2 id="CMIP-PDB-Preparation-(from-Molecular-Dynamics-topology)">CMIP PDB Preparation (from Molecular Dynamics topology)<a class="anchor-link" href="#CMIP-PDB-Preparation-(from-Molecular-Dynamics-topology)">¶</a></h2><p>When working with <strong>structure conformations</strong> taken from <strong>MD simulations</strong>, it is recommended to use the <strong>charges, atom types and elements</strong> considered in the simulation. Usually this information is stored in the so-called <em><strong>topology</strong></em> files. A specific <strong>building block</strong> (<em><strong>prepare_structure</strong></em>) is available to extract these information from an <strong>MD topology file</strong> and use it for the <strong>CMIP calculations</strong>.</p>
<p>The next cells are taking one frame of the <strong>MD simulation</strong>, splitting the subunits (chains) in two different <strong>PDB files</strong>, and preparing them to be used in <strong>CMIP</strong>, taking the <strong>charges and elements</strong> used in the simulations from the <strong>MD topology file</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="CMIP-Boxes">CMIP Boxes<a class="anchor-link" href="#CMIP-Boxes">¶</a></h2><p><strong>CMIP</strong> computes <strong>interaction energies</strong> using <strong>3D grids</strong> (see image). <strong>CMIP</strong> tries to automatically built a <strong>grid</strong> enclosing the  structure under study, which is fine in most of the cases. However, when working with <strong>protein-protein interactions</strong>, the <strong>grid</strong> needs to be adjusted to the system. The next cells are computing and showing the <strong>3D grids</strong> needed to enclose the two <strong>monomers</strong> and the <strong>complex</strong>, and are useful to inspect them and re-define them, increasing the size, if needed.</p>
<p>A specific property of the <strong>cmip building block</strong> (<em>execution_type = check_only</em>) allows the calculation of the <strong>3D grids</strong>, and accepts params such as <em>perfill</em>, which specifies the <strong>portion of the grid</strong> filled by the input (host) structure or <em>box_size_factor</em>, which increases the <strong>size of the grid</strong>. The computed <strong>grids</strong> can be then used as an input for the final <strong>interaction energies</strong> calculations.</p>
